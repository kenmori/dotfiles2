#clipboard
## System clipboard integration
#
# This file has support for doing system clipboard copy and paste operations
# from the command line in a generic cross-platform fashion.
#
# On OS X and Windows, the main system clipboard or "pasteboard" is used. On other
# Unix-like OSes, this considers the X Windows CLIPBOARD selection to be the
# "system clipboard", and the X Windows `xclip` command must be installed.

# clipcopy - Copy data to clipboard
#
# Usage:
#
#  <command> | clipcopy    - copies stdin to clipboard
#
#  clipcopy <file>         - copies a file's contents to clipboard
#
